How-do-you-that-in-Lisp-
========================

An assortment of (usually) standalone Lisp functions that deal with list manipulation, working with matrices, and other functionality. Useful for someone learning Lisp or perhaps needing a simple function. Implementations are by no means brilliant, just straightforward Lisp, here. In all functions I attempted to be as functionally pure as possible. 

All functions should have provided usage tests to verify that they perform as promised. A caveat: I hacked these functions together from various homework assignments, programming projects, and cases where I needed to satisfy my own curiousity. If something is missing or broken, consider it a learning opportunity instead of a mistake on my part ;). 

You will need to set the load path properly (around line 150 of TestSuite1.lisp and 168 of TestSuite2.lisp) in orer to run the tests.
