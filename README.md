How-do-you-that-in-Lisp-
========================

An assortment of (usually) standalone Lisp functions that deal with list manipulation, working with matrices, and other functionality. Useful for someone learning Lisp or perhaps needing a simple function. Implementations are by no means brilliant, just straightforward Lisp, here. In all functions I attempted to be as functionally pure as possible.
